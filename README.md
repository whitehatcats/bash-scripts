# Bash Scripts

This is a collection of Bash scripts I'm creating as I learn Linux, shell scripting, and DevOps.

Each script is part of my hands-on journey to practice system automation and build my portfolio.

## 📜 Scripts

### `system-info.sh`
Displays basic system information:
- Hostname
- Uptime
- OS version
- Kernel
- CPU model
- Memory usage

### `disk-check.sh`
Checks the current disk usage of the root filesystem (`/`).  
If usage is over a set threshold (default: 80%), it prints a warning.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is part of my DevOps learning path.  
I'm using it to practice scripting and automation while building a personal portfolio.

## 🛠️ Usage
